othello game for university course, it was a fun experience and i learned a lot about c programming language.
you can play it with your friend or by yourself, it has both single player mode and two players mode.
and here is rules of the game:
  - One player plays black and the other white. Each player gets 32 discs and black always starts the game.
  - A player can place a disc on an empty square if it outflanks one or more of the opponent's discs. Outflanking means forming a row of discs that ends with the player's color on both sides.
  - The outflanked discs are flipped to the player's color.
  - If a player cannot outflank any discs, they lose their turn and the opponent continues.
  - The game ends when both players have no valid moves or the board is full.
  - The player with the most discs of their color wins the game.

Hope you enjoy it!
